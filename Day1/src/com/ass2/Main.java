//	Race Condition :-  this condition we want to avoid cause it may cause to crash our code in reace condition multiple thread are work on a same element at same time . for example if we try to Send money by ATM and PhonePay at same time then if i have account balance is rs 5000 and i try to get 5000 by phone pay and if also at same time i m try to use ATM to get money if both transection happen at onece then my account balance is go into  minus state and this will not a good sign so to avoid this we use syncronization and we try to avoid this Race Condition by providing one transection at a time .
